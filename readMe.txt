The testFactor.py is the script to test the best parameter for SVD and KNN
The surpriseLab.py is the script which run through the Random, KNN and SVD to get the result
The mf.py is the script to get the result from matrix factorization. User need to manually set the 5 fold cross-validation data(from u1.base/u1.test --> u5.base/u5.test). The K value is adjustable
The dnn.py is the script of the two structure of the neural netwrok.  User need to manually set the 5 fold cross-validation data(from u1.base/u1.test --> u5.base/u5.test).
mfCompare.py is the script of the result comparesion between the MF and Random,KNN,SVD
mdDnn.py is the scripy of  result comparesion between the MF and Neural Nework
dnnCompare.py is the scripy of result comparesion between the Meural Network and andom,KNN,SVD
compare.py is the script of result comparesion between the KNN, Random and SVD
